Form validation in javascript.

The validations are as follows:
•	The username field must contain only letters.
•	The password field should be at least 8 characters long.
•	The email address field should contain a @ character.

When the field is currently being edited, the notification element’s text is visible.
When the field is not being edited:
•	If the field is empty, the notification element is hidden.
•	If the field is non-empty and the form field validates, the notification element’s text should is “OK” and visible.
•	If the field is non-empty and the form field does not validate, the notification element’s text should is “Error” and visible.
